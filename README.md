# dobedobe (ABANDONED)
Dobedobe was a primitive attempt to classify reddit users into political compass positions. It achieved mediocre success at this task.

With changes to reddit's API, it is no longer viable for me to scrape data. Because of this, I've archived a few of the old datasets in the hopes they'll be useful in the future. They contain ~40k users comment history and declared political position at the time of collection. These will be available at request.
